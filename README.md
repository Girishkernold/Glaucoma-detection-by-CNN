My College project -- Glaucoma detection by Convolutional neural networks (A deep learning model)
Developed by combined with 3 different datasets and utilizing CNN, tensorflow, keras modules and library
By Flask and SQLalchemy, we made it into a web application.

How it works??
User/patient will uploads their retinal images in the homepage after they have logged in with their credentials.
Then our model will detects the significance of the glaucoma disease and displays the results on the screen.
